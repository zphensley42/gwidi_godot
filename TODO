- Create better cmake structure to not require individual builds / exports for all targets
- Create better cmake commands to output all headers for use in the godot scons project as well
-- Alternatively, make scons look at a more central location for all the headers (the cmake project)

- UPDATE to the above: Just do find_package stuff locally and make a top-level install cmake to run install commands for all projects instead of doing an install PER project
