- MADE A GWIDI OPTIONS 2 for json, make a tick processor given the data it defines and the graph here:

- Lots of TODOs in the godot project itself, but I think it boils down to a few main things for now:
-- The building/binding/display of all of the measures/octaves/notes need to be dependent on the currently selected instrument configuration. This means:
--- Build file selector in godot to pick the config
--- Parse config after selected (in gwidi_options)
--- Provide parsed config from gwidi_options back to godot script
--- Convert parsed config to GUI by rebinding measures/octaves/notes to match existing configuration for the instrument
---- Primarily: # of octaves, letter notes in the octaves
-- Options for adding/removing/setting the # of measures currently available
--- This needs to tie-into the track length in gwidi data itself (tick?)
-- Once the above 2 things are done, update to use gwidi for the initial data creation and begin adding controls back to gwidi to update the data
