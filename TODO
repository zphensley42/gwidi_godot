NEW IMPORTANT ONE: Fix inefficiency with play -> new playback in Godot project, specifically this breaks Pause but also is needed for Play to work with Gui data. Remove the tickmap stuff and just use the data directly??



- Lots of TODOs in the godot project itself, but I think it boils down to a few main things for now:
--- Build file selector in godot to pick the config
--- Parse config after selected (in gwidi_options)
--- Provide parsed config from gwidi_options back to godot script
--- Convert parsed config to GUI by rebinding measures/octaves/notes to match existing configuration for the instrument
---- Primarily: # of octaves, letter notes in the octaves
-- Options for adding/removing/setting the # of measures currently available
--- This needs to tie-into the track length in gwidi data itself (tick?)
-- Once the above 2 things are done, update to use gwidi for the initial data creation and begin adding controls back to gwidi to update the data
